DIY Arduino Mandalorian Rangefinder

As a maker, DIYer, and major Star Wars nerd, I wanted to make a rangefinder HUD to go along with my Mandalorian helmets. 
This project uses an Arduino (Uno/Nano specifically for pinout), and a Waveshare 1.51 inch transparent OLED display using the U8G2 Arduino library.

Feel free to modify it to your desire, but mine shows a reticle in the center with simulated target locks and distances to said simulated targets.
Let me know if there are any feature suggestions or bugs!
